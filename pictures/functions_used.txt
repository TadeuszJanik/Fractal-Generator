1. The Life of Fractal - f(z) = z^5 - 1, using generalized Newton's iteration for 4 different parameters ranging from 1 to ~1+0.9i, number of iterations adjusted for variety of colours.
2. Fractal in the Making - f(z) = z^6 - (16+4i)*z^3 +(12+3i)*z, parameter=1+0.925i, 100 iterations, no shading
3. Generalized Newton's Iterations - f(z) = z^3+31z^2+62i, parameter=0.1+i, colour chosen after 100 iterations, no shading
